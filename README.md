### Introduction
This is my A-Level Computer Science programming project. This project is designed to help secondary school students up to GCSE level with their mathematical problems. 
This was designed with 3 stakeholders and based on their feedback. This project achieved **A\*** at A-Level. The documentation can be found

### Features
You can solve the following problem types:
* Index laws
* Solving quadratic equations
* Simultaneous equations

Ideally I would havve wanted to implement more problem types, however this was as much as I had time for.
